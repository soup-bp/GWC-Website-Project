    <h1>Hi.</h1>
    <h2>This is a website on how to make a website.</h2>

        <h3>There aren't multiple pages to this because I'm lazy so make like Dory and just keep <s>swimming</s> scrolling!</h3>
        <p>The three most important elements needed for a responsive, sleek website (like this one :P) is an HTML file for the core content, CSS stylesheet to make it look pretty, and JavaScript code to make the pretty stuff even fancier (more responsive to clicks and user input and stuff).</p>
        
        <h3>STEP 1: </h3> <h4>Have an Idea</h4>
        <p>This is arguably the most important step. If you don't have an idea to execute, don't bother wasting your time building a full-fledged website. Sure, it's good to practice and sharpen your skills in HTML/CSS/JavaScript every once in a while, but if you don't have a concrete, realistic idea to execute don't spend too much time working on creating a website for it.</p>
    
        <h3>STEP 2: </h3> <h4>Make Your HTML File and CSS Stylesheet</h4>

        <p><b>2.0 </b> The first thing you should probably do is make a folder to house all your files related to the project. This is an optional step, but I recommend doing it because

                <li>Being organized is very attractive and cool (Source: urmom.edu)</li>
                <li>I save everything to my desktop and it is actual chaos whenever I look for something so please for the love of all things holy make folders AND ACTUALLY USE THEM PLEASE</li>
            </ol>

            <b>2.1</b> Now we're actually getting into it (yuh). Open up a plain text file on your computer. Use Notepad if you're on school laptops but if not use VS Code, it's 100x easier to operate. Save the file to your computer as "whateveryouwant.html". Don't forget the .html at the end and to ensure the file type you're saving as is HTML (<i>HyperText Markup Language</i> for all you fancypants).
            At the top of the file you're going to want to type this stuff, which I'll explain how to do below.
